Instead of going for a metal unibody design, the Samsung Galaxy On5 sports a sturdy metal frame, and a rear cover that looks and feels like leather. This design ensures that the phone not only looks professional and classy, but also stands out from the crowd.
With its compact, 12.67-cm HD display, the phone can easily fit into almost any pocket. Not to mention the fact that you will be able to use the phone with just one hand quite easily.
